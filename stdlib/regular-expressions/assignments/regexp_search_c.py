* Assignment: Regexp Search Time
* Complexity: medium
* Lines of code: 4 lines
* Time: 5 min

English:
    1. Use regular expressions to check text [1] contains time in UTC (format: `%H:%M UTC`)
    2. Use simplified checking: `##:## UTC`, where `#` is a digit
    3. Define `result: str` with matched time
    4. Run doctests - all must succeed

Polish:
    1. Użyj wyrażeń regularnych do sprawdzenia czy tekst [1] zawiera godzinę w UTC (format: `%H:%M UTC`)
    2. Użyj uproszczonego sprawdzania: `##:## UTC`, gdzie `#` to dowolna cyfra
    3. Zdefiniuj `result: str` ze znalezionym czasem
    4. Uruchom doctesty - wszystkie muszą się powieść
